%%
%% Method 2: Use XeLaTeX directly:
%%   xelatex "resume.tex"
%%   (run multiple times to resolve cross-references if needed)
%%
%% PDF ---(pdf2htmlEX)> HTML:
%%
%% Install pdf2htmlEX from https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX, then:
%%   alias pdf2htmlEX='docker run -ti --rm -v `pwd`:/pdf bwits/pdf2htmlex pdf2htmlEX'
